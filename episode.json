    "description": "In this episode of the /Filmcast, David, Devindra, and Adam debate how good the Religulous trailer really is, remember the good old days when Eddie Murphy used to say “Fuck,” try to ignore the hype/hate behind the Valkyrie trailer, and geek out about Kung Fu Panda. Special guest bloggers Mike Sonders joins us from Great White Snark and Myles McNutt joins us from Cultural Learnings."
